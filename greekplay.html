        <h1>Ashwith Sai presents a Greek play by Sophocles </h1>
        <h3>Electra and the Author Sophocles </h3>
        <p><b>CH</b><br>
             Say, is Aegisthus near while thus you speak?
Or hath he left the palace? We would know.</p>
<p><b>EL</b><br>
 Most surely. Never think, if he were by,
I could stray out of door. He is abroad.</p>
<p><b>CH</b><br>
 Then with less fear I may converse with thee.</p>
 <p><b>EL</b><br>
 Ask what you will, for he is nowhere near.</p>
 <p><b>CH</b><br>
First of thy brother I beseech thee tell,
How deem’st thou? Will he come, or still delay?</p>
<p><b>EL</b><br>
 His promise comes, but still performance sleeps.</p>
 <p><b>CH</b><br>
Well may he pause who plans a dreadful deed.></p>
<p><b>EL</b><br>
EL. I paused not in his rescue from the sword.</p>
<p><b>CH</b><br>
 Fear not. He will bestead you. He is true.</p>
 <p><b>EL</b><br>
 But for that faith my life had soon gone by.</p>
 <p><b>CH</b><br>
No more! I see approaching from the house
Thy sister by both parents of thy blood,
Chrysothemis; in her hand an offering,
Such as old custom yields to those below.</p>
<p><b>EL</b><br>
Tis strange and pitiful, thy father’s child
Can leave him in oblivion and subserve
The mother.</p>
<p><b>CH</b><br>
Tis certain; when Aegisthus comes again.</p>
<p><b>EL</b><br>
If that be all, let him return with speed!
