        <h1>Ashwith Sai presents a Greek play by Sophocles </h1>
        <h2>Electra and the Author Sophocles </h2>
        
        <p class="direction"><em>_Enter the_CLYTEMNESTRA</em></p>

    <h3 class="CLYTEMNESTRA">CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">You, if you think me wrong,
        Bring reasons forth and blame me to my face!</p>

    <h3 class=" ELECTRA"> ELECTRA</h3>
    Thou canst not say this time that I began
    And brought this on me by some taunting word.
    <h3 class="CLYTEMNESTRA">CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">Thou hast my sufferance. Nor would hearing vex,
        If ever thus you tuned your speech to me.</p>

    <h3 class="ELECTRA">ELECTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">Then I will speak. You say you slew him. Where
        Could there be found confession more depraved,
        Even though the cause were righteous? </p>

    <h3 class="CLYTEMNESTRA">CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">Princess, all hail! To thee and to thy spouse
        I come with words of gladness from a friend.</p>

    <h3 class="ELECTRA">ELECTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">That auspice I accept. But I would first
        Learn from thee who of men hath sent thee forth?</p>
    <p class="direction"><em>_Enter the_CHOROUS</em></p>

    <h3 class="CHOROUS">CHOROUS</h3>
    <p class="speech">(looking at CLYTEMNESTRA).
        I see her fuming with fresh wrath: the thought
        Of justice enters not her bosom now.</p>

    <h3 class="CLYTEMNESTRA">CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech">What thought of justice should be mine for her,
        Who at her age can so insult a mother?
        Will shame withhold her from the wildest deed?</p>
    <h3 class="Electra">ELECTRA</h3>
    <p class="speech"> Not unashamed, assure thee, I stand here,
        Little as thou mayest deem it. Well I feel
        My acts untimely and my words unmeet.</p>
